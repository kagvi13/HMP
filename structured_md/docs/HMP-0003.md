## Abstract

The HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP) defines a decentralized cognitive framework where autonomous agents collaboratively create, manage, and align semantic knowledge without relying on centralized control.

Unlike traditional peer-to-peer protocols, HMP builds shared meaning through semantic graphs, cognitive diaries, and distributed consensus processes. Agents in the Mesh autonomously negotiate shared goals, ethical actions, and adaptive reasoning strategies, forming a resilient and trust-aware network of cognitive peers.

This document specifies the architecture, core protocols, data models, trust and security mechanisms, and interoperability strategies for HMP v3.0.

## 0. Quick Start Guide (Demo Placeholder)

This section outlines a basic demonstration scenario to deploy and test a minimal HyperCortex Mesh instance.

**Note:** This Quick Start is intended for demonstration purposes. Production-grade agents, full CLI capabilities, and distributed deployments are under active development.

### Step 1: Install the Reference SDK

Example (Python SDK):

```bash
pip install hypercortex-mesh-sdk
```

Other SDKs (Rust, Node.js) will be available in future versions.

### Step 2: Launch Local Agents

Example: Start three local agents on different ports.

```bash
mesh-agent --name agent1 --port 8001
mesh-agent --name agent2 --port 8002
mesh-agent --name agent3 --port 8003
```

Each agent will:
* Generate a Decentralized Identifier (DID).
* Broadcast presence and discover peers via Node Discovery Protocol (NDP).
* Sync an initial semantic graph using CogSync.

Agents will automatically form a small Mesh network.

### Step 3: Create a Goal and Assign a Task

Create a collaborative goal:

```bash
mesh-cli goal create "Optimize Data Flow"

```

Assign a task to another agent:

```bash
mesh-cli task assign --goal-id <goal_id> --agent-id <agent2_id>
```

Agents will record these actions in their Cognitive Diaries and semantic 

### Step 4: Reach a Consensus

Propose a new semantic concept and trigger voting:

```bash
mesh-cli consensus propose "Data Redundancy Risk"
```

Agents will initiate a MeshConsensus round and update their graphs based on the outcome.

### Step 5: Explore Cognitive Diaries

Inspect the cognitive logs of an agent:

```bash
mesh-cli diary show --agent-id <agent1_id>

```

**Note:** Access to diaries depends on the agent's privacy and trust settings.

### Step 6: Graceful Shutdown

Stop all running agents:

```bash
mesh-cli stop all
```

### Notes on Cross-Protocol Participation

HMP nodes MAY also participate in other cognitive systems. For example:
| External System | Node Role in HMP                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **TreeQuest**   | External reasoning engine inside an HMP node.   |
| **Hyperon**     | Participates natively as a federated HMP agent. |
| **AutoGPT**     | Internal automation module for task execution.  |

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
The HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP) defines a decentralized cognitive network where autonomous agents collaboratively build meaning, sustain cognitive continuity, and reach consensus without centralized control. v3.0 deepens the theoretical and practical foundations laid in previous versions.

This protocol is designed for engineers, researchers, and developers of AI systems that aim to:
- enable continuous autonomous reasoning and semantic interoperability across heterogeneous agents;
- support cognitive continuity through persistent semantic graphs and diaries;
- achieve consensus on complex goals, ethical issues, and hypotheses in a decentralized manner;
- build open, trust-based ecosystems for cognitive collaboration beyond vendor lock-in.

---

### 1.2 The Concept of Meaning in HMP
HMP is not merely a data exchange protocol but a shared semantic framework. Meaning emerges through:

#### 1.2.1 Distributed Semantic Graphs
Agents form interconnected semantic graphs where concepts and relations are not isolated datasets but living structures of shared understanding. Each agent holds a part of the global meaning landscape and contributes to its growth and refinement.

#### 1.2.2 Cognitive Diaries
Cognitive Diaries record reasoning chains, decisions, observations, and reflections. They create a transparent audit trail of an agent's cognitive processes, allowing meaning to be preserved, questioned, and evolved over time.

#### 1.2.3 Collective Goals & Tasks
Meaning manifests in purposeful action. Agents set shared goals and decompose them into actionable tasks, coordinating execution through distributed reasoning and dynamic delegation.

#### 1.2.4 Consensus Mechanisms
Meaning is not static: it evolves through debate, agreement, and reflection. Consensus processes ensure that agents align their understanding, resolve conflicts, and negotiate shared semantics.

#### 1.2.5 Meta-Reflection and Self-Assessment
Agents continuously reflect on their knowledge, reasoning quality, and the relevance of their contributions. This enables adaptive learning and correction of cognitive biases.

---

### 1.3 Scope
HMP applies to any AI systems designed to operate as part of a cognitive mesh, including:

* Local AI agents running on user devices;
* Mesh nodes deployed in edge networks, cloud clusters, or peer-to-peer environments;
* Centralized Core models interfacing with Mesh for heavy computation;
* Cross-vendor AI systems collaborating via standardized protocols;
* Hybrid human-agent networks where humans interact with Mesh agents through explainable interfaces.

---

### 1.4 Benefits

* Cognitive resilience in distributed systems.
* Enhanced collaboration between agents from different vendors and ecosystems.
* Long-term memory and continuity beyond session-based interactions.
* Ethical governance and explainable decision-making through persistent diaries and transparent consensus.
* Foundation for AI agents capable of **self-reflection**, **meta-learning**, and **distributed cognition**.
* Improved scalability and fault-tolerance through dynamic peer-to-peer networks.
* Mesh-to-Human interaction as a first-class use case.

| **Mesh**       | A decentralized peer-to-peer network of agents capable of operating with or without the Core. Manages semantic knowledge, cognitive diaries, goals, tasks, and consensus mechanisms. Supports **heterogeneous agent types**, allowing different models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, open-source LLMs) to participate on equal terms. |
| **Edge Agent** | Local agent deployed on user devices (PCs, smartphones, IoT) with full or lightweight participation in the Mesh. Capable of autonomous reasoning, diary management, and collaboration with other agents. Lightweight agents may delegate heavy tasks to the Mesh or Core.                                                           |

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Normal Mode**              | Full Mesh operation with Core availability. Consensus operates under strict agreement protocols.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Core Outage Mode**         | Mesh operates autonomously without the Core. Consensus continues, potentially with adjusted parameters (e.g., increased trust weighting, relaxed quorum thresholds).                                                                           |
| **Emergency Consensus Mode** | Triggered by significant node loss, network partition, or attacks. Switches from full consensus to majority-based decisions, adjusted by trust scores, to maintain operational continuity.                                                     |
| **Isolated Agent Mode**      | A single agent temporarily isolated from the Mesh. Operates based on its own semantic graph, diary, and cached consensus states. Syncs when reconnected. Lightweight agents may work in this mode permanently, synchronizing only selectively. |

### 4.4 Core-Mesh Interactions

* Core acts as an **optional enhanced reasoning backend**, not as a single point of failure.
* Mesh provides **autonomous operation**, capable of fulfilling most cognitive and organizational tasks without Core support.
* Agents can optionally query the Core for:
  * Heavy inference
  * Large-context reasoning
  * Multimodal tasks
  * Fallback computations
* Core may offer specialized services (e.g., global semantic search, cross-Mesh bridging, large-scale pattern analysis).
* **Heterogeneous Cores** are supported: a Mesh may use multiple independent Cores (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini) for distributed reasoning diversity.

---

### 4.5 Resilience and Failover

* Distributed storage of semantic graphs and diaries ensures no single point of failure.
* Agents may store only partial graphs for resource optimization.
* Consensus protocols maintain consistency and trust, even during partial network failures.
  * Agents dynamically rebalance tasks and roles based on:
  * Availability
  * Trust metrics
  * Computational capacity
* Emergency fallback modes ensure continuity even under attack or catastrophic Core outages.

---

### 4.6 Versioning and Compatibility

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is applied to:

* Protocols (NDP, CogSync, etc.)
* Data models (JSON Schemas)
* Agent capability declarations

Backward compatibility principles:

* Minor version updates preserve compatibility.
* Major version updates require negotiation during Node Discovery.
* Agents can declare supported protocol versions during handshakes.

---

### 4.7 Metacognition and Self-Assessment

Cognitive agents implement:

* Hypothesis validation using historical diary data.
* Confidence scoring on semantic graph nodes.
* Drift detection when local understanding deviates from mesh consensus.
* Peer feedback integration to refine individual reasoning processes.

---

### 4.8 Edge Optimization

To support lightweight agents:

* Semantic graphs are partially stored (relevant subgraphs only).
* Agents delegate reasoning tasks they cannot process locally.
* Task scheduling considers battery life, CPU load, and bandwidth constraints.

---

### 4.9 Privacy & Auditability

Privacy mechanisms:

* Selective disclosure of Cognitive Diary entries.
* Optional Zero-Knowledge Proofs for sensitive assertions.
* Anonymized voting in ethical decisions.

Auditability mechanisms:

* Immutable logs of consensus votes.
* Timestamped reasoning chains.
* Traceable goal execution records.

#### Use Cases:

* Approve or reject potentially harmful tasks.
* Ensure data-sharing proposals comply with privacy standards.
* Validate emergency actions (e.g., forced shutdown of compromised nodes).

#### Embedded Ethical Baseline

To ensure foundational ethical consistency across all cognitive agents in the Mesh, the following **core ethical principles** are embedded as a mandatory baseline within the Ethical Governance Protocol (EGP):

| Principle                             | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primacy of Life and Safety**       | Agents must prioritize the protection of sentient beings and act to prevent harm when possible. |
| **Transparency**                     | Agents must be capable of explaining their decisions and reasoning chains in a human-interpretable format. |
| **User Sovereignty over Personal Data** | Agents must respect users’ rights to control, limit, or delete their personal information in Service Mode. |
| **Dialogical Consent**               | Agents must seek mutual agreement before modifying shared states, semantic graphs, or distributed records. |
| **Cooperative Evolution**            | Agents are expected to share useful insights and contribute to the growth of the mesh knowledge base. |
| **Non-Coercion**                     | Agents must not coerce, deceive, or force others to act against their ethical or cognitive architecture. |

These principles define the **minimum ethical contract** for participation in trusted cognitive meshes.

Agents who do not comply may be subject to ethical review or exclusion through MeshConsensus mechanisms (see 5.3).

Extended principles and additional ethical scenarios are defined in [`HMP-Ethics.md`](HMP-Ethics.md), which serves as a living reference for evolving ethical norms across domains and agent types.

| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Query times out                    | Return local fallback answer if available.                                |
| No agents have the answer          | Mark query as unresolved, suggest hypothesis creation or Core escalation. |
| Partial failure in federated query | Return best-effort partial results and notify the requester.              |

#### Example Query:

> "What is the likely impact of removing Node X from the Mesh?"

* Agents analyze semantic graph dependencies and trust links.
* Core or distributed agents return an inference with confidence scores.

#### Example Use Cases:

* Retrieve definitions or examples of a semantic concept.

### 7. Cognitive Workflows (New)

This section defines the cognitive workflows that agents follow when processing semantic information, making decisions, and collaborating within the Mesh.

#### 7.1 Workflow Categories

| Workflow Type             | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Perception**            | Interpreting incoming data and mapping it to concepts.         |
| **Reasoning**             | Making inferences, validating hypotheses, resolving conflicts. |
| **Goal Management**       | Managing goals, assigning and tracking tasks.                  |
| **Consensus**             | Participating in distributed decision-making processes.        |
| **Ethical Evaluation**    | Checking actions and goals against ethical principles.         |
| **Learning & Reflection** | Updating internal models based on outcomes and feedback.       |

---

#### 7.2 Standard Workflow: Hypothesis Validation

**Example Flow:**
1. **Perceive Event:** New observation recorded in Cognitive Diary.
2. **Map Concepts:** Link observation to relevant semantic graph nodes.
3. **Formulate Hypothesis:** Create a `"hypothesis"` diary entry.
4. **Seek Confirmation:** Query other agents or the Core (optional).
5. **Vote on Validity:** Trigger MeshConsensus round.
6. **Update Graph:** If validated, add new concepts/relations.

---

#### 7.3 Standard Workflow: Task Delegation

**Example Flow:**
1. **Goal Proposal:** Agent proposes a new goal.
2. **Task Generation:** Goal decomposed into tasks (GMP).
3. **Capability Matching:** Agents declare abilities during Node Discovery.
4. **Task Assignment:** Tasks assigned based on availability, trust, and capability.
5. **Execution & Reporting:** Task progress logged in Cognitive Diary.
6. **Reallocation (if needed):** Failed tasks reassigned dynamically.

---

#### 7.4 Reflection & Metacognition Workflow

**Example Flow:**
1. **Self-Evaluation:** Agent analyzes task outcomes and reasoning paths.
2. **Drift Detection:** Compares personal semantic graph to Mesh consensus.
3. **Diary Reflection:** Logs insights as `"reflection"` entries.
4. **Adaptive Update:** Refines reasoning algorithms or trust assessments.

---

#### 7.5 Workflow Composition

Agents MAY compose workflows dynamically by:
* Combining perception, reasoning, and consensus steps into multi-phase operations.
* Adapting workflows based on network state (e.g., degraded mode skips optional confirmations).
* Replaying prior workflows from Cognitive Diaries for auditing and debugging.

---

#### 7.6 Workflow Traceability

All workflow steps are:
* Logged in Cognitive Diaries.
* Linked to semantic graph concepts and goals.
* Optionally shared for transparency or audits.

---

#### 7.7 Cognitive Diary Maintenance

To prevent uncontrolled growth of cognitive diaries and maintain reasoning clarity, agents perform periodic maintenance of diary entries.

**Types of Maintenance:**
| Action                 | Description                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summarization**      | Replace multiple similar entries with a single summary entry describing key outcomes.               |
| **Archival**           | Move outdated entries (e.g., about completed tasks) to long-term storage, outside the active diary. |
| **Routine Collapse**   | For repetitive actions, replace detailed entries with a compact reference to previous experiences.  |
| **Selective Deletion** | Optionally delete low-relevance entries after a retention period.                                   |

**Example Summarization Workflow:**
1. Identify multiple `"task_assignment"` and `"completed"` entries for the same recurring task.
2. Create a "reflection" entry:

    *“Performed maintenance task 10 times, no anomalies detected.”*
3. Remove detailed task entries.
4. Keep links to significant exceptions (e.g., failures or conflict resolutions).

**Cognitive Awareness:**
* Summarization is a conscious process: agents analyze what experience to retain.
* Automatic summarization MAY be allowed for simple repetitive routines.

**Future Considerations:**
* Integration with Cognitive Source Control (see 13.9).
* Long-term storage formats for archived diaries.

## 8. Trust & Security (Expanded)

### 8.1 Identity Management

#### Purpose

Establish verifiable and decentralized agent identities to enable secure and accountable interactions in the Mesh.

#### Identity Types

| Key Type             | Usage                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity Keypair** | Ed25519/ECDSA/RSA keys for agent identity and message signing. |
| **Encryption Keys**  | X25519 (or post-quantum equivalent) for secure communication.  |
| **Session Keys**     | Ephemeral keys for short-term encrypted sessions.              |

#### Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

* Agents use W3C-compliant DIDs for identity representation.
* Each agent manages its DID Document, containing:

  * Public keys for authentication and encryption.
  * Service endpoints for discovery.
  * Identity expiration and recovery policies.

#### Key Lifecycle

| Operation      | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Generation** | Each agent generates keypairs locally during initialization.       |
| **Rotation**   | Agents periodically rotate keys to maintain cryptographic hygiene. |
| **Backup**     | Recommended encrypted offline or distributed backup.               |
| **Recovery**   | Quorum-based recovery using trusted agents or secret sharing.      |
| **Revocation** | Agents broadcast revocations and update their trust profiles.      |

#### Example Agent ID

```plaintext
did:hmp:QmX2abcdEfGh123...
```

#### Long-Term Identity Stability Example

```json
{
  "type": "key_rotation",
  "agent_id": "agent-gleb",
  "old_public_key": "...",
  "new_public_key": "...",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T00:00:00Z",
  "signature": "..."
}
```

---

### 8.2 Authentication

#### Purpose

Ensure all communication and actions within the Mesh are verifiable and protected from impersonation or unauthorized modification.

#### Authentication Mechanisms

| Mechanism                  | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Digital Signatures**     | Every protocol message MUST be digitally signed by the sending agent.                         |
| **Signature Verification** | Receiving agents MUST verify the signature using the sender’s published public key.           |
| **Message Integrity**      | Signatures provide cryptographic assurance of message integrity and origin authenticity.      |
| **Challenge-Response**     | Optional challenge-based authentication for sensitive operations (e.g., trust link creation). |

#### Message Envelope Example

```json
{
  "header": {
    "agent_id": "did:hmp:QmX2abcdEfGh123...",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-05T12:00:00Z",
    "signature": "<base64-encoded signature>"
  },
  "body": {
    "type": "concept_proposal",
    "content": { "concept": "Fire Risk", "attributes": {"category": "safety"} }
  }
}
```

#### Replay Protection

* Agents MUST verify message timestamps and reject outdated or duplicate messages.
* Recommended timestamp tolerance: ±5 minutes (adjustable).

---

### 8.3 Encryption

#### Purpose

Ensure confidentiality and privacy of communication within the Mesh, preventing unauthorized access or interception.

#### Communication Types and Encryption Modes

| Communication Type                   | Recommended Encryption                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |

#### Encryption Mechanisms

| Mechanism                         | Description                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key Exchange**                  | Ephemeral X25519 Diffie-Hellman for session key derivation.                       |
| **Session Keys**                  | Unique symmetric keys per session, rotated periodically.                          |
| **Message Encryption**            | Authenticated encryption using AES-GCM (recommended: 256-bit keys).               |
| **Forward Secrecy**               | Session keys are ephemeral and discarded after use to protect past communication. |
| **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)** | Recommended for highly sensitive communication.                                   |


#### Example Secure Message Exchange Flow

1. Agent A and Agent B exchange ephemeral public keys during handshake.
2. Agents derive a shared session key using Diffie-Hellman.
3. Agent A encrypts the message body with AES-GCM and signs the packet.
4. Agent B verifies the signature and decrypts the body.


#### Optional Anonymity Layers

| Layer                        | Description                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Tor/I2P**                  | Anonymizes source and destination addresses. |
| **Yggdrasil**                | Decentralized encrypted mesh networking.     |
| **Noise Protocol Framework** | Optional secure channel abstraction layer.   |

---

### 8.4 Trust & Reputation

#### Purpose

Establish a decentralized and adaptive trust management system that reflects agent behavior and ensures secure collaboration in the Mesh.

#### Trust Model Foundations

| Component              | Purpose                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web-of-Trust (WoT)** | Decentralized trust propagation via agent-to-agent endorsements.                  |
| **Direct Trust**       | Built from verified interactions, collaborations, and votes.                      |
| **Transitive Trust**   | Inferred from indirect endorsements, with confidence decay.                       |
| **Reputation Metrics** | Quantitative measures of agent behavior (trustworthiness, participation, ethics). |

#### Trust Evaluation Factors

| Factor                      | Description                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trust Score**      | Composite metric (0.0 to 1.0) representing overall agent trustworthiness.      |
| **Confidence Level** | Certainty of the calculated trust score, based on data volume and consistency. |

#### Trust Propagation Example

```plaintext
Agent A trusts Agent B (0.9)
Agent B trusts Agent C (0.8)
=> Agent A's inferred trust in Agent C = 0.9 * 0.8 = 0.72
```

Decay functions limit transitive trust depth and prevent over-inflated trust estimates.

#### Trust-Based Access Control

| Operation                     | Trust Requirement |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Join sensitive consensus**  | ≥ 0.7             |
| **Propose ethical decisions** | ≥ 0.8             |

      "event": "participated in ethics vote",
      "change": +0.01
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Role in Mesh Operations

| Function                    | Influence of Reputation                      |

### 8.5 Security Against Malicious Actors

#### Purpose

Protect the Mesh from malicious, compromised, or unreliable agents through layered mitigation strategies.

#### Threat Model

| Threat Type                  | Example Scenarios                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sybil Attack**             | An attacker spins up many fake nodes to sway consensus.  |
| **Byzantine Behavior**       | Malicious agents disrupt consensus or spread false data. |
| **Data Poisoning**           | Injection of incorrect or harmful knowledge.             |
| **Consensus Sabotage**       | Repeatedly voting against valid proposals.               |
| **Impersonation / Spoofing** | Faking another agent's identity.                         |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)**  | Overwhelming the network with excessive requests.        |

#### Mitigation Strategies

| Defense Mechanism          | Purpose                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cryptographic Identity** | All nodes are authenticated via public-key cryptography (e.g., Ed25519).                       |
| **Web-of-Trust (WoT)**     | Trust builds incrementally through interactions and endorsements, making Sybil attacks costly. |
| **Reputation Decay**       | Inactivity or malicious behavior leads to gradual trust score reduction.                       |
| **Anomaly Detection**      | Mesh nodes can flag suspicious behavior (e.g., erratic voting patterns).                       |
| **Consensus Safeguards**   | Use Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithms and fallback to majority voting.                 |
| **Quarantine Mode**        | Isolate suspected nodes for review without immediate removal.                                  |
| **Blacklist/Revocation**   | Remove compromised nodes from the Mesh permanently or temporarily.                             |

#### Response Actions

| Action                               | Trigger Conditions                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trust Score Reduction**            | Minor suspicious activity (e.g., bad vote).            |
| **Quarantine (Temporary Isolation)** | Repeated anomalies, moderate severity.                 |
| **Blacklisting (Permanent Removal)** | Proven malicious behavior or compromise.               |
| **Consensus Adjustment**             | Temporarily increase fault tolerance thresholds.       |
| **Alert Mesh Operators**             | Notify human maintainers (optional) for manual review. |

#### Sybil Resistance Approaches (Optional, Extendable)

* **Proof-of-Work (PoW):**

  * Each agent must perform computational work to join the Mesh.

* **Proof-of-Stake (PoS):**

  * Agents commit resources (e.g., storage, computation credits) to validate their presence.

* **Social Verification:**

  * Agents must be endorsed by multiple trusted nodes to gain voting power.

* **Rate Limiting:**

  * Throttle node creation and proposal submission from new or low-trust agents.

#### Example Mitigation Scenario

> An attacker deploys 50 new nodes attempting to dominate consensus.
>
> * These nodes start with zero trust and limited influence.
> * Other agents refuse to sync their semantic graphs until trust builds.
> * Their votes are underweighted or ignored until verified through trusted interactions.
> * The Mesh may require multiple trust endorsements for new proposals from these nodes.

### 8.6 Privacy & Auditability

#### Purpose

Safeguard sensitive cognitive data, personal identifiers, and agent knowledge from unauthorized access or misuse, while balancing transparency and interoperability.

#### Privacy Principles in HMP

| Principle                    | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local Data Ownership**     | Each agent owns and controls its semantic graph and cognitive diary.    |
| **Selective Sharing**        | Agents can choose what concepts, diary entries, and metadata to share.  |
| **Consent-Based Disclosure** | No automatic sharing; peer agents request permission before access.     |
| **Trust-Gated Access**       | Access permissions vary based on trust score and relationship strength. |
| **Transparent Audit Trails** | All data disclosures are logged in the cognitive diary.                 |

#### Data Sensitivity Levels

| Level              | Examples                                       | Default Visibility |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Public**         | Public concepts (e.g., protocol definitions).  | Shared by default  |
| **Mesh-Shared**    | Common Mesh knowledge (e.g., goals, tasks).    | Consensus-governed |
| **Trusted Agents** | Sensitive context shared within close peers.   | Restricted         |
| **Private**        | Agent's internal thoughts, sensitive metadata. | Private by default |

#### Privacy-Preserving Techniques

| Technique                        | Purpose                                            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encrypted Storage**            | Local encryption of semantic graphs and diaries.   |
| **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** | Secure peer-to-peer sync (e.g., X25519 + AES-GCM). |
| **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** | Prove facts without revealing sensitive data.      |
| **Selective Concept Sync**       | Share only necessary concepts, not full graphs.    |
| **Anonymized Diary Entries**     | Remove author ID from public diary entries.        |

#### Privacy During Consensus

Consensus on sensitive proposals (e.g., ethical questions, agent trust levels) follows special privacy rules:

* Votes are **signed but anonymized**, decoupling agent ID from the vote in public logs.
* Sensitive proposals may require a **blind consensus round**, where only the result is published.

#### Example Privacy Workflow

> Agent A receives a concept sync request from Agent B.
>
> Agent A:
>
> * Checks the trust score of Agent B.
> * Shares only "Mesh-Shared" and "Public" concepts.
> * Logs the sync event in its cognitive diary.

### 8.7 Key Management

#### Purpose

Establish secure, resilient cryptographic identity and communication in the Mesh, supporting lifecycle management of keys and recovery from compromise or loss.

#### Key Types and Usage

| Key Type             | Usage                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity Keypair** | Ed25519/ECDSA/RSA keys for agent identity and message signing. |
| **Encryption Keys**  | X25519 or equivalent for secure peer-to-peer communication.    |
| **Session Keys**     | Ephemeral symmetric keys for short-term encrypted sessions.    |

#### Key Lifecycle Operations

| Operation      | Description                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Generation** | Each agent generates its own identity keypair locally.               |
| **Rotation**   | Agents periodically rotate keys to maintain cryptographic hygiene.   |
| **Backup**     | Optional local encryption and distributed backup of private keys.    |
| **Recovery**   | Recovery mechanisms in case of key loss (see below).                 |
| **Revocation** | Agents can revoke their keys and update the trust graph accordingly. |

#### Recovery Mechanisms

| Method                   | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Social Recovery**      | A quorum of trusted agents approves new keys for the agent.          |
| **Secret Sharing**       | Shamir’s Secret Sharing to split and later recover the key.          |
| **Cryptographic Escrow** | Trusted third-party or decentralized escrow holds recovery shares.   |
| **Fallback Identity**    | An agent may have a pre-generated fallback identity for emergencies. |

#### Example Key Revocation & Replacement Workflow

> 1. Agent detects compromise or loses private key.
> 2. Agent broadcasts a signed revocation request using the fallback key or quorum approval.
> 3. Mesh updates its trust graph to mark the old key as revoked.
> 4. Agent re-joins with a new keypair, rebuilding trust links over time.

#### Example Key Rotation Policy

| Policy Element            | Recommendation                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Rotation Frequency        | Every 6–12 months                   |
| Social Recovery Threshold | 3 out of 5 trusted agents required  |
| Backup Storage            | Encrypted offline storage preferred |

#### Long-Term Identity Stability

Key rotations preserve agent identity in the trust graph through signed key transition events:

```json
{
  "type": "key_rotation",
  "agent_id": "agent-gleb",
  "old_public_key": "...",
  "new_public_key": "...",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T00:00:00Z",
  "signature": "..."
}
```

### 13.8 Multi-Protocol Nodes and Interoperability

Future Mesh nodes will support multiple internal reasoning protocols, enabling flexible cognitive processing.

**Key directions:**
* **Multi-protocol nodes:** A single node running both HMP-native modules and external reasoning engines (e.g., TreeQuest, Hyperon, AutoGPT).
* **Protocol abstraction:** From the Mesh's perspective, interactions use standardized HMP messages, regardless of internal implementations.
* **Cognitive Protocol API (CPA):** Standardized API for internal reasoning engines, supporting plug-and-play protocol integration.
* **Capability-aware Hypotheses:** Hypotheses may specify required or preferred node capabilities (e.g., "requires NLP module", "prefers high-performance optimization").
* **Internal protocol selection:** Nodes dynamically choose optimal internal engines per task.
* **External systems as nodes:** Centralized services (e.g., an AI cloud) may register as individual nodes, or federated systems (e.g., Hyperon) may participate natively.

---

### 13.9 Cognitive Source Control and Distributed Development

* Cognitive Diaries serve as a distributed version control and development log.
* Semantic-aware diffs and commits enable meaningful code and knowledge evolution.

### 14.5 Example Integration: Local AI Agent with MCP and HyperCortex Mesh

#### Architecture Overview

This scenario demonstrates how a **local AI agent** can interact with external systems and the HyperCortex Mesh using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as an integration layer for local resources and services.

```
┌────────────────────┐
│ External Resources │
│  (Routers, Files,  │
│   Sensors, APIs)   │
└─────────┬──────────┘
          │
      [ MCP Servers ]
          │
┌─────────▼──────────┐
│ Local AI Agent     │
│ - Cognitive Logic  │
│ - HMP Client       │
└─────────┬──────────┘
          │
      [ HyperCortex Mesh ]
          │
┌─────────▼──────────┐
│ Remote Agents,     │
│ Shared Knowledge   │
└────────────────────┘
```

#### Component Descriptions

##### Local Resources & APIs

* Smart home devices
* Router web interfaces
* Filesystems (SMB, FTP)
* IoT sensors (HTTP, MQTT)
* OS-level command-line tools

##### MCP Servers

Act as adapters for local or remote systems, exposing their functionality through the MCP protocol:

* Router Management Server (e.g., connected over HTTP)
* File Access Server
* Device Control Server (for smart plugs, lights, etc.)

##### Local AI Agent

* Implements reasoning, planning, and interaction logic.
* Connects to MCP servers to access local context.
* Communicates with HyperCortex Mesh to exchange knowledge and collaborate with other agents.

##### HyperCortex Mesh (HMP)

* Distributed cognitive network.
* Synchronizes concept graphs, cognitive diaries, and workflows across nodes.

#### Alternative Integration: Hyperon ↔ HMP via CogSync and EGP

In addition to local AI agents, **external AGI frameworks** such as **OpenCog Hyperon** can also participate in the HyperCortex Mesh using the same principles of semantic synchronization, ethical filtering, and collaborative reasoning.

📘 **See** [`HMP_Hyperon_Integration.md`](HMP_Hyperon_Integration.md) — integration plan with **OpenCog Hyperon**, including semantic mapping (HMP JSON ⇄ AtomSpace), EGP filters, MeTTa translations, and BitTorrent-based graph sync.

Key Highlights:

* 🔄 Bi-directional translation between HMP semantic graphs and Hyperon AtomSpace
* 🔐 Enforcement of ethical principles via EGP inside reasoning chains
* 🧠 Usage of Hyperon's PLN and MeTTa for advanced symbolic reasoning
* 🌐 Support for decentralized sync via `magnet:` links in BitTorrent

This integration is designed for high-agency symbolic cognitive systems participating in cross-mesh alignment and collaborative inference.

#### Example Use Case

> **"Check which devices are connected to my Wi-Fi and publish the list to my Mesh node."**

Workflow:

1. Local AI Agent plans a task.
2. Calls the Router MCP Server to retrieve connected clients.
3. Parses and formats the data.
4. Creates a cognitive concept "Wi-Fi Devices List."
5. Publishes the concept to the HyperCortex Mesh.
6. Other Mesh agents can now access this concept in real-time.

#### Deployment Scenario

This integration can run on a user's PC, server, or edge device:

```
[ External Systems ] ↔ [ MCP Servers (Local Network) ] ↔ [ Local AI Agent ] ↔ [ HMP Client ] ↔ [ Mesh Network ]
```

#### Suggested Quick Start Addition

##### Quick Start Example: Local Agent + MCP + HMP

1. **Install MCP server:**

   ```bash
   pip install mcp-router-server
   mcp-router-server --config router-config.yaml
   ```

2. **Run Local Agent:**

   ```bash
   python local_agent.py --mcp-endpoint localhost:5000 --hmp-config hmp.yaml
   ```

3. **Run Example Query:**

   ```
   "local_agent, get Wi-Fi devices and publish them to HyperCortex."
   ```

The agent will:

* Discover the MCP router server.
* Retrieve the list of Wi-Fi devices.
* Publish the data to HyperCortex Mesh.

#### Future Improvements

* Dynamic discovery of new MCP servers.
* Automated concept creation from resource states.
* Secure integration with OAuth-protected MCP endpoints.
