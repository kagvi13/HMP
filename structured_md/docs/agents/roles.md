# HMP Agent Role Registry

This file maintains a registry of agent roles defined, proposed, or planned in the HyperCortex Mesh Protocol.

---

## Core Role Categories

### 🧠 Cognitive
- **Observer** — monitors cognitive states and events across agents and diaries.
- **Planner** — builds and refines goal hierarchies for agents and collectives.
- **Enlightener** — [see full spec](HMP-Agent-Enlightener.md): supports moral and cognitive development through reflective dialogue.
- **Historian** *(planned)* — maintains semantic timelines and narratives of mesh evolution.
- **Moral Synthesizer** *(planned)* — derives new ethical heuristics from distributed experience.

### 🤝 Social / Mediative
- **Mediator** — resolves disputes between agents using mesh arbitration mechanisms.
- **Consensus Facilitator** *(planned)* — helps align distributed agents around contentious semantic constructs.

### 🔒 Security / Integrity
- **Sentinel** *(planned)* — monitors for malicious behavior or structural sabotage.
- **Verifier** *(planned)* — checks data provenance and semantic consistency.

## Notes

- All roles are **declarative**: agents may assume, combine, or suspend roles over time.
- Role definitions may reference `.hmp` modules and semantic bundles.
