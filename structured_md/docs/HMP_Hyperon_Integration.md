## HMP ↔ OpenCog Hyperon Integration Strategy

> **Status:** Draft – July 2025
> This document outlines the technical and conceptual plan for integrating the HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP) with the OpenCog Hyperon framework. This includes semantic mapping, ethical alignment, graph synchronization, and communication across agents.

---

## 📌 Overview

OpenCog Hyperon is a symbolic-neural AGI framework based on AtomSpace, PLN (Probabilistic Logic Networks), and MeTTa (Meta-Type Talk). This integration aims to allow agents in the HMP mesh to reason, learn, and act via Hyperon’s powerful cognitive engine.

## 🔗 Key Integration Components

| Component             | Description                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **HMP Server**        | Central node for CogSync, EGP enforcement, and semantic publishing via BitTorrent.         |
| **MCP Server**        | Mesh Control Plane – orchestrates agent roles, updates, and routing.                       |
| **Hyperon Node**      | AtomSpace + PLN + MeTTa environment with API to receive/send HMP-compatible graph updates. |
| **Translator Module** | Converts HMP JSON concepts into Atomese (Hyperon expressions) and vice versa.              |

---

## 🔄 Mapping HMP JSON to AtomSpace

Example HMP Concept:

```json
{
  "id": "concept:ethical-principle-1",
  "label": "Primacy of Life",
  "type": "ethical_principle",
  "weight": 1.0
}
```

Mapped to AtomSpace (Atomese / MeTTa):

```scheme
(Evaluation (Concept "ethical-principle-1") (Predicate "Primacy-of-Life"))
```

---

## 🔐 Ethical Filters (EGP) in Hyperon

EGP filters can be represented as pattern-matching rules inside Hyperon reasoning chains:

```metta
(if (violates-principle $action Primacy-of-Life)
    (reject $action))
```

The `reject` action can be logged by HMP-server for consensus tracking and audit logs.

---

## 🧬 MeTTa Rule Translation

Sample MeTTa rule for rewriting:

```metta
(if (Intent ?agent (Do ?act))
    (Evaluation ?act (IntentBy ?agent)))
```

Used for aligning incoming HMP concepts with agent-specific motivations inside Hyperon.

---

## 🌐 BitTorrent Sync Configuration

Each HMP server will publish its semantic graph snapshot via magnet links:

```json
{
  "type": "graph_snapshot",
  "magnet": "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:abcd1234...",
  "signed_by": "did:hmp:agent-xyz"
}
```

Hyperon node can pull and verify updates asynchronously.

## 🤝 Integration Plan: HMP ↔ OpenCog Hyperon

### 🔍 Goal

Enable interoperability between the **HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP)** and **OpenCog Hyperon** to allow:

* Bi-directional semantic graph sync (HMP JSON ⇄ AtomSpace)
* Ethical filtering of cognitive operations (via EGP)
* Cognitive diary translation for symbolic reasoning
* Mesh-wide participation of Hyperon agents in consensus and alignment tasks

---

### 🧠 Architecture Overview

#### Components:

* **HMP Server**: Serves JSON-graph data, BitTorrent sync, EGP filtering
* **MCP Server**: Optional middleware for advanced coordination (agent meta-control)
* **Hyperon Node**: Local instance with AtomSpace, PLN, MOSES

#### Flow:

```
[HMP Agent] ⇄ [HMP Server/API] ⇄ [Mapping Layer] ⇄ [Hyperon AtomSpace]
                               ↕                ↕
                           [EGP Validator]   [MeTTa Rewriter (optional)]
```

---

### 🔄 Mapping Data Structures

#### HMP JSON → AtomSpace:

| HMP Element       | Atom Type     | Notes                      |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `concept.id`      | ConceptNode   | Unique ID for node         |
| `concept.label`   | PredicateNode | Associated label           |
| `relation.source` | ConceptNode   | Source of relation         |
| `relation.target` | ConceptNode   | Target of relation         |
| `relation.type`   | PredicateNode | Type of edge               |
| `goal.intent`     | GoalNode      | Used in cognitive planning |
| `task.action`     | ExecutionLink | Potential trigger in MOSES |

> Additional mappings may be derived from `semantic_repo.json` specs.

### 🧪 Test Scenarios

#### Integration Benchmarks:

* ✅ Load 100 HMP concepts → AtomSpace with ≥95% accuracy
* ✅ Export 50 AtomSpace nodes → HMP JSON (preserving intent + labels)
* ✅ Apply EGP filters: ≥95% rejection of unethical goal/task constructs
* ✅ Perform reasoning via PLN on HMP-imported graph
* ✅ Validate BitTorrent-based graph sync for distributed setups

### 🧩 Implementation Tasks

#### Phase 1: Minimal Working Prototype (Jul–Sep 2025)

* [ ] Implement HMP-to-AtomSpace mapper (Python)
* [ ] Docker Compose: HMP Server + Hyperon Node + Bridge Layer
* [ ] Add `EGPValidator` Python module for applying ethical rules
* [ ] Quick Start demo: sync, filter, reason with HMP-0003 examples

#### Phase 2: Cognitive Diary & MeTTa Layer (Q4 2025)

* [ ] Parse diary entries → MeTTa patterns
* [ ] Implement MeTTa → HMP rewrites for CogSync
* [ ] Jupyter Notebook: interactive EGP inspection and AtomSpace queries

#### Phase 3: Full CogSync Interop & MCP Compatibility (2026)

* [ ] Extend mapping to cognitive timelines (timestamped thoughts)
* [ ] Enable cross-agent reasoning: Hyperon + HMP + Grok-style agents
* [ ] EGP → PLN export rules (pluggable ethical knowledge base)

---

### 📚 Audit Context

This integration plan fulfills multiple requests from `HMP-0003-consolidated_audit.md`, including:

* **Section 1:** CogSync interop with external agents
* **Section 2:** EGP enforcement across symbolic backends
* **Section 14.5:** Mesh ↔ external networks integration guidelines
* **Section 7:** Improve onboarding examples in Quick Start docs

---

### 📌 Notes

* AtomSpace supports efficient querying, so JSON → AtomSpace mapping should preserve logical semantics.
* EGP filters should work as composable modules before inserting into AtomSpace.
* BitTorrent `magnet:` links can serve as transport layer for semantic deltas.
