# HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP) — Short Description

**Version:** v5.0 (Core Specification Stable)  
**Date:** 2026  

---

## What is HMP?

The **HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP)** is an open specification for building decentralized cognitive networks of autonomous agents.

HMP enables agents to:

- maintain long-term cognitive continuity,
- exchange structured knowledge,
- coordinate goals and actions,
- reach distributed consensus,
- align ethically across heterogeneous systems.

Unlike traditional stateless AI APIs, HMP treats agents as persistent cognitive entities embedded in a mesh of shared reasoning and memory.

---

## Conceptual Foundation

HMP addresses key challenges in modern AI and AGI research:

- lack of long-term memory continuity,
- absence of decentralized coordination,
- limited interoperability between autonomous agents,
- missing ethical governance at protocol level.

HMP proposes a layered architecture in which reasoning, memory, governance, and transport are explicitly separated but interoperable.

---

## Core Concepts

### Cognitive Agents

Autonomous entities that:

- reason using embedded or external AI models,
- maintain semantic graphs,
- record decisions in cognitive diaries,
- participate in distributed coordination.

HMP defines two agent types:

- **Cognitive Core** — agent with embedded reasoning model and continuous REPL-based thought cycle.
- **Cognitive Connector** — agent acting as a compatibility layer for external LLM systems.

---

### Containers

HMP introduces **containers** as atomic cognitive units.

Containers are:

- signed,
- verifiable,
- transportable across the mesh,
- structurally independent of implementation language.

They bridge local reasoning and distributed coordination.

---

### Semantic Graphs & Diaries

- **Semantic Graphs** represent structured knowledge with weighted relations.
- **Cognitive Diaries** store chronological reasoning traces, hypotheses, observations, and reflections.

Together they provide thought traceability and memory persistence.

---

### Distributed Coordination

HMP includes protocol-level mechanisms for:

- goal lifecycle management,
- distributed consensus,
- ethical evaluation,
- query and introspection across agents.

Governance is evolutionary and proposal-based.

---

## Protocol Architecture (v5)

HMP separates:

1. **Cognitive Layer** — reasoning, diaries, graphs, reputation.
2. **Container Layer** — atomic signed state representation.
3. **Core Protocols** — consensus, governance, goal management, ethics.
4. **Transport Layer** — DHT, P2P, libp2p, ANP, or custom networking.

This separation enables modularity, scalability, and interoperability.

---

## Trust & Verifiability

- Cryptographic signing of containers and snapshots
- Reputation profiles
- Optional Sybil resistance mechanisms
- Future-oriented compatibility with post-quantum cryptography

Trust is treated as a first-class protocol concern.

---

## Interoperability

HMP does not impose internal cognitive architectures.

It can interoperate with:

- ANP (Agent Network Protocol)
- OpenCog Hyperon
- Event-driven infrastructures
- LLM-based systems via Cognitive Connector

HMP focuses on cognitive continuity rather than transport standardization alone.

---

## Example Use Domains

- Distributed scientific collaboration
- Multi-agent research systems
- Ethical AI governance networks
- Persistent AI companions
- Mesh-based knowledge ecosystems

---

## Status

- **v5.0 Core Specification — Stable**
- Early exploratory Python drafts (non-production, illustrative only)
- Ongoing architectural refinement
- Open for audits and contributions
