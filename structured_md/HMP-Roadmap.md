# 🧭 HyperCortex Mesh Protocol – Roadmap

## 🔍 Overview

This roadmap outlines the key stages of development and enhancement for HMP, structured by feature groups and incorporating feedback from multiple advanced AI models (Copilot, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen).

---

## ✅ Completed (v4.0)

* Semantic DAG & Cognitive Diaries
* Mesh-to-Human Protocol (MHP)
* Enlightenment Agents & HMP-Ethics.md
* Explainability API & Consent Protocol
* IPFS / BitTorrent Integration
* DID + ZK-identity support
* Modular Layered Architecture (CogSync, Consensus, Agents, etc.)
* Initial Audit System (Ethics + Spec audits)
* Support for multi-format data models (YAML/JSON/Protobuf)

---

## 🔨 Planned: v4.1

### 🧑‍💻 Developer Experience

* [ ] Beginner’s Guide ("Create Your First Agent")
* [ ] Step-by-step tutorial: Agent -> Mesh -> Diary
* [ ] Diagrams: architecture, agent lifecycle, cognitive flow
* [ ] CLI for managing HMP-agents (Python prototype evolving)
* [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md + clear onboarding steps

### 📊 Performance & Compression

* [ ] Performance Benchmarks Section

  * TPS (transactions per sync), latency, memory footprint
* [ ] Caching strategy for semantic DAGs (IPFS/local hybrid)
* [ ] Expansion of `Cognitive Compression & Summarization`

  * Prioritization, auto-archiving, intelligent forgetting

### ⚖️ Ethical Governance Enhancements

* [ ] Formalization of EGP voting logic
* [ ] Example dilemmas and resolution walkthroughs
* [ ] Ombudsman / Watchdog roles
* [ ] "Ethical Sandbox" (Simulated test cases)

---

## 🧪 Experimental & Future (v4.2+)

### 🌐 Mesh Simulation & Agent Interaction

* [ ] Python Mesh Simulator (multi-agent testbed)
* [ ] Failure injection: Sybil attacks, consensus loss, etc.
* [ ] Reputation model dynamics

### 🧠 AI Interaction Layer

* [ ] Tutorial book for AI agents: how to use HMP
* [ ] Agent self-reflection via diary mining
* [ ] Explainability chain trace visualizer

### 🕸️ External Integrations

* [ ] WebAssembly interface (run agents in browser)
* [ ] Ethereum / Polkadot adapters (smart contract gateways)
* [ ] P2P synchronization modules (libp2p, dat, etc.)

### 🔐 Formal Verification (Long-term)

* [ ] Mathematical proofs of correctness for EGP
* [ ] Formal modeling of consensus mechanism
