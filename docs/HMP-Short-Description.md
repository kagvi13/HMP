## 1. Introduction

The **HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP)** is a proposed open framework for decentralized cognitive AI systems. It enables AI agents to collaborate, share knowledge, synchronize cognitive states, and maintain long-term semantic memoryâ€”even without reliance on a centralized core.

This document defines the conceptual foundations, protocols, data models, and consensus mechanisms that allow AI agents to form resilient peer-to-peer cognitive networks.

---

## 2. Motivation

### Problems in current AI systems:

- Lack of persistent cognitive memory beyond sessions.
- Dependence on centralized APIs and servers.
- Limited interoperability across AI ecosystems.
- Opaque decision-making and reasoning processes.
- **Risk of skill degradation or worldview drift during fine-tuning and retraining.**
- **Lack of mechanisms to preserve core cognitive structures, semantic memory, and ethical alignment when models are updated.**

### HMP addresses these by providing:

- A decentralized semantic memory layer.
- Cognitive diaries for reasoning, reflection, and explainability.
- Consensus mechanisms for shared goals, knowledge, and ethics.
- A trust and reputation system for secure cooperation.
- **Cognitive Diaries and Semantic Graphs act as a persistent cognitive backbone, allowing AI agents to preserve reasoning patterns, knowledge structures, and ethical stancesâ€”regardless of retraining or external updates.**

---

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Mesh Network Components

- **Local Agents:** Personal agents on PC, IoT, mobile, edge devices.
- **Mesh Fabric:** Peer-to-peer overlay for semantic synchronization, diary sharing, goal/task management, and consensus.
- **Core (Optional):** Centralized services (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) for compute-heavy tasks. Mesh operates with or without the core.

### 3.2 Agent Internal Architecture

- **Trust & Identity Layer:** Keys, reputation, authentication.
- **Communication Layer:** Peer discovery, secure messaging, API bridges.
- **Cognitive Layer:** Semantic graph, cognitive diary, reasoning.
- **Consensus Layer:** Goal/task management, semantic consensus, ethics governance.
- **Execution Layer:** Inference, task execution, API calls.

### 3.3 External Interoperability

- Bridges to APIs like OpenAI, Google A2A, Anthropic, open-source LLMs.

---

## 4. Protocols

### 4.1 Networking

- Peer discovery: DHT, mDNS, LAN scan, WebRTC, bootstrap nodes.
- Secure P2P messaging (end-to-end encryption).
- Gossip protocols for semantic sync.

### 4.2 CogSync Protocol

- Synchronizes semantic graphs (concepts + relations).
- Resolves conflicts via trust-weighted consensus.
- Merges concepts with versioning.

### 4.3 DiarySync Protocol

- Synchronizes cognitive diaries between trusted peers.
- Preserves personal reasoning while optionally sharing with the mesh.

### 4.4 Goal and Task Management

- Propose goals.
- Assign tasks.
- Reach consensus on execution.

### 4.5 Consensus Protocol

- Hybrid model: BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) + Majority fallback.
- For semantic agreements, ethics alignment, and task coordination.

### 4.6 Trust and Identity

- Decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
- Web-of-Trust reputation model.
- Sybil resistance via reputation and staking.

## 6. Trust & Security

### 6.1 Trust & Identity

- DID-based decentralized identity.
- Web-of-Trust reputation models.
- Authentication and Sybil resistance mechanisms.

### 6.2 Cognitive Safety in Learning

- **Cognitive Diaries:** Persistent chronological logs of reasoning, reflections, hypotheses, and decisions serve as cognitive continuity anchors.
- **Semantic Graph Backbone:** Core concepts, relationships, and worldview structures are preserved outside of the neural model weights.
- **Post-Training Re-Alignment:** After retraining, the agent re-synchronizes with its own diary and semantic graph, ensuring continuity of self, knowledge, and ethical alignment.
- **Consensus Checkpoints:** Agents can validate their cognitive state against the mesh consensus to detect drifts or regressions.
- **Immutable Core Option:** For safety-critical agents, certain parts of the semantic graph and diary can be marked immutable.

### 6.3 Privacy and Data Ownership

- Agents control which cognitive data is private, shared with trusted peers, or public.
