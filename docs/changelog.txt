### HMP-0002 (July 2025) — Draft Version 2.0

**Major Changes**
* Reorganized the document structure for clarity and consistency.
* Added **Versioning** and **Use Case** definitions in the Definitions section.
* Expanded **Trust Layer** with clearer explanations of key management, social recovery, and Sybil resistance.
* Introduced the concept of **Edge Optimization** for lightweight agents.
* Enhanced descriptions in **Mesh Operation Modes**, particularly around resilience and agent autonomy.

**Protocol Updates**
* Refined **Node Discovery Protocol (NDP)** with better NAT traversal and bootstrap node handling.
* Updated **Cognitive Sync Protocol (CogSync)** to include partial sync, compression, and data prioritization.
* Improved **Mesh Consensus Protocol (MeshConsensus)** with fallback mechanisms and trust-weighted voting adjustments.
* Clarified responsibilities of the **Ethical Governance Protocol (EGP)**, including ethics versioning and dynamic adjustment.
* Added clarification on **Goal Management Protocol (GMP)** error handling and task reassignment.

**Data Model Improvements**
* Formalized JSON Schemas for all major data models (**Concept**, **CognitiveDiaryEntry**, **Goal**, **Task**, **ConsensusVote**, **ReputationProfile**).
* Improved field descriptions and added optional fields for better interoperability.
* Added versioning and metadata fields to support long-term data evolution.

**Cognitive Layer Enhancements**

* Expanded description of cognitive diaries as auditable reasoning chains.

**Trust & Security Enhancements**
* Introduced key rotation and social recovery mechanisms.
* Detailed Sybil resistance strategies combining Web-of-Trust with optional resource verification.
* Refined privacy considerations for sensitive data in semantic graphs and diaries.

**Future Work Roadmap Expanded**
* New focus areas added: interoperability testing, UX tools for semantic and cognitive layers, and resilience simulations.

### HMP-0001 (June 2025) — Draft Version 1.0

**Initial Draft**
