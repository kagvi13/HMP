HMP-0002 (July 2025) â€” Draft Version 2.0

**Major Changes**
* Reorganized the document structure for clarity and consistency.
* Added **Versioning** and **Use Case** definitions in the Definitions section.
* Expanded **Trust Layer** with clearer explanations of key management, social recovery, and Sybil resistance.
* Introduced the concept of **Edge Optimization** for lightweight agents.
* Enhanced descriptions in **Mesh Operation Modes**, particularly around resilience and agent autonomy.

**Protocol Updates**
