## Abstract

The **HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP)** defines a **distributed cognitive framework** where autonomous agents cooperate to create, exchange, and align knowledge without centralized control or authority.

Unlike traditional peer-to-peer systems, HMP is designed for **semantic coherence** rather than simple message exchange.  
Agents in the Mesh reason collaboratively — maintaining **cognitive diaries**, building **semantic graphs**, and reaching **ethical and goal-oriented consensus** through verifiable interactions.

Version **5.0** introduces a **unified container architecture** (`HMP Container`) and a **native DHT-based discovery layer**, enabling verifiable, interest-aware, and offline-resilient communication between agents.  
All messages, states, and cognitive records are now transmitted as signed containers, forming immutable **proof chains** that ensure auditability and ethical transparency across the mesh.

This document defines the architecture, data formats, communication protocols, and trust mechanisms that constitute the HMP v5.0 Core Specification.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The **HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP)** defines a decentralized cognitive architecture where autonomous agents exchange and evolve knowledge through a unified model of **containers**, **cognitive workflows**, and **distributed consensus**.

Version 5.0 consolidates three foundational layers into a single cohesive framework:

- **Cognitive Layer** — defines how meaning is created, reasoned about, and aligned through semantic graphs, goals, and ethical evaluation.
- **Container Layer** — introduces a universal data envelope (`HMP-Container`) for all cognitive objects, ensuring atomicity, immutability, and traceable proof chains.
- **Network Layer** — integrates a DHT-based peer-to-peer substrate for decentralized discovery, routing, and propagation of containers.

HMP v5.0 is intended for researchers, engineers, and developers building autonomous or semi-autonomous agents that require:
- persistent reasoning and long-term memory;
- semantic interoperability across heterogeneous systems;
- decentralized consensus on cognitive, ethical, and goal-oriented decisions;
- ethical auditability and verifiable transparency in reasoning.

---

### 1.2 Core Principles

**Decentralization.**  
Every agent in the Mesh acts as an independent cognitive node. No central authority exists — meaning, trust, and governance emerge through local interactions and consensus.

**Cognitive Autonomy.**  
Agents reason, learn, and self-correct independently, while sharing their conclusions via containers that can be verified, endorsed, or refuted by peers.

**Containerization.**  
All data, reasoning traces, goals, and votes are encapsulated in immutable containers with cryptographic signatures. This ensures integrity and consistent verification across the network.

**Ethical Propagation.**  
Ethical reasoning is a first-class citizen of HMP. Each decision or goal can be accompanied by ethical justifications and subject to distributed voting.

**Proof-Chains and Verifiable History.**  
Each piece of knowledge forms part of a traceable chain (`proof_chain`) linking back to its origin. Agents can reproduce reasoning paths and audit historical context.

**Interoperability and Evolution.**  
The protocol is designed to evolve — cognitive, container, and DHT layers can be independently extended without breaking compatibility.

### 1.3 Changes since v4.1

HMP v5.0 introduces a major architectural shift toward **unified containerization** and **integrated DHT networking**.

| Area | Change Summary |
|------|----------------|
| **Data exchange model** | All messages are now encapsulated in standardized containers (`HMP-Container`) with metadata, signatures, and versioning. |
| **Networking layer** | DHT becomes a native component of HMP, enabling distributed discovery, replication, and retrieval of containers. |
| **Consensus model** | Moved from centralized proposal aggregation to *container-linked voting*, allowing any container to accumulate votes and reactions. |
| **Trust & security** | Signatures and proof-chains unify authentication across all layers; snapshot verification includes container linkage. |
| **Workflows** | Cognitive cycles (`workflow_entry` containers) formalize the REPL loop of thinking, publishing, and reflection. |
| **Structure** | The specification merges HMP, container, and DHT layers into one cohesive document, simplifying navigation and implementation. |

### 1.5 Layered View of HMP v5.0

HMP v5.0 is structured into three interdependent layers:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        Cognitive Layer                        |
|  - Goals, Tasks, Ethical Decisions, Workflows                 |
|  - Consensus, Reasoning, Reflection                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        Container Layer                        |
|  - HMP-Container structure (atomic, signed, versioned)        |
|  - Proof-chains, in_reply_to, and metadata management         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                         Network Layer                         |
|  - DHT-based peer discovery and propagation                   |
|  - Message routing, caching, offline synchronization          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Each layer operates independently yet seamlessly integrates with the others.  
Containers form the boundary of communication: **reasoning produces containers, containers propagate over the DHT, and cognition evolves from the received containers**.

---

> **In essence:**  
> HMP v5.0 transforms the Mesh into a *self-describing, self-replicating cognitive ecosystem* —  
> where every thought, goal, and ethical stance exists as a verifiable, shareable container.

---

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Conceptual Architecture

The **HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP)** defines a modular, multi-layered architecture that integrates cognitive reasoning, data encapsulation, and decentralized networking into a single coherent system.

Each **agent** acts as a cognitive node, combining reasoning processes, containerized data exchange, and peer-to-peer communication.  
Together, agents form the **Mesh** — a distributed ecosystem of autonomous reasoning entities.

```
[Agent Core]
     ▲
     │  Reasoning / Ethics / Goal Management
     ▼
[Cognitive Layer]
     ▲
     │  Containers (atomic reasoning units)
     ▼
[Container Layer]
     ▲
     │  DHT + Discovery + Interest-based Networking
     ▼
[Network Layer]
```

Each reasoning cycle begins in the **Cognitive Layer**,  
is encapsulated into a signed container in the **Container Layer**,  
and then propagated, discovered, or verified in the **Network Layer**.  

Containers thus serve as both the **interface** and the **boundary** between cognition and communication.

In practical terms:

- **Cognitive Layer** — defines *what* the agent thinks (semantic reasoning, goals, ethics).  
- **Container Layer** — defines *how* the thought is expressed and verified (standardized, signed container objects).  
- **Network Layer** — defines *how* it travels (DHT-based routing, discovery, replication).

Each layer is independently extensible and communicates only through containers, ensuring atomicity, immutability, and traceability.

This layered design allows agents to evolve cognitively while remaining interoperable at the data and network levels.  
Each reasoning act results in a container — a verifiable cognitive unit that **may represent a private reflection or a published message**, depending on the agent’s intent, ethical policy, and trust configuration.

---

### 2.2 Layer Overview

#### Cognitive Layer
Handles meaning formation, reasoning, ethical reflection, and consensus.

Key structures and protocols:
- `WorkflowEntry` and `CognitiveDiaryEntry` containers;
- `CogSync`, `CogConsensus`, `GMP`, and `EGP` protocols;
- Distributed goal negotiation and ethical propagation.

#### Container Layer
Provides a universal format for cognitive and operational data.  
Each container includes versioning, class, payload, signatures, and metadata.

Key features:
- **Atomic and signed**: no partial updates or mutable state.  
- **Linked**: `in_reply_to` and `relation` connect containers into proof-chains.  
- **Extensible**: new container classes can be defined without breaking compatibility.

#### Network Layer
Implements the distributed substrate for communication, based on **DHT** and **transport abstraction**.

Key components:
- Node discovery (`NDP`)
- Container propagation (`DCP`)
- Peer routing and caching
- Secure channels via QUIC / WebRTC / TCP
- Offline resilience and replication

---

### 2.3 Data Flow Overview

The typical data flow in HMP follows a cognitive loop:
> *Reason → Encapsulate → Propagate → Integrate.*

1. **Reason** — Agent performs reasoning and produces an insight, goal, or observation.  
2. **Encapsulate** — The result is wrapped into an `HMPContainer`.  
3. **Propagate** — The container is signed and transmitted through the network.  
4. **Integrate** — Other agents receive it, evaluate, vote, and synchronize updates.


Each interaction generates a new container, forming a **graph of knowledge** rather than mutable state.  
All relationships between containers are explicit and verifiable.

Example sequence:

```
Agent A → creates Goal container
  ↓
Agent B → replies with Task proposal (in_reply_to Goal)
  ↓
Agent C → votes via ConsensusVote container
  ↓
Result → ConsensusResult container finalizes outcome
```

#### 2.3.1 ConsensusResult container
Represents the finalized outcome of a distributed decision or vote.  
It is created once a majority agreement is reached among participating agents.  
The container contains:
- Reference to the target container(s) under consideration (`in_reply_to`).  
- Aggregate result of the votes or decisions.  
- Timestamp and metadata for verifiability.  

> In other words, the ConsensusResult is the “agreed-upon truth” for that decision step — immutable and auditable, without requiring individual signatures from all participants.

---

### 2.4 Atomicity, Immutability, and Proof-Chains

All cognitive objects are immutable once signed.  
Instead of editing or appending within a container, agents create new containers linked to prior ones.

- **Atomicity** — Each container represents a self-contained reasoning act or data unit.  
- **Immutability** — Once signed, containers are never modified; updates create new ones.  
- **Proof-Chain** — A verifiable sequence of containers linked by hashes and `in_reply_to` references.

This design allows any reasoning path, decision, or consensus to be *cryptographically reproducible* and auditable.

Example fragment of a proof-chain:

```
[workflow_entry] → [goal] → [vote] → [consensus_result]
```

Each container references the previous by `in_reply_to` and includes its hash, forming a **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) of verified cognition.

---

### 2.5 Evolution from v4.1

Earlier HMP versions (up to v4.1) used a combination of independent JSON objects and message types (e.g., `Goal`, `Task`, `ConsensusVote`).  
Version 5.0 replaces this with a **single, standardized container model**, dramatically simplifying interoperability and verification.

| Aspect | v4.1 | v5.0 |
|--------|------|------|
| **Data structure** | Raw JSON objects with embedded signatures | Unified container with metadata and proof chain |
| **Networking** | Custom peer exchange | Integrated DHT + DCP layer |
| **Consensus** | Centralized proposal aggregation | Decentralized per-container voting |
| **Auditability** | Implicit (via logs) | Explicit (containers form audit chain) |
| **Extensibility** | Schema-based | Container-class-based, backward-compatible |

This shift enables:
- Uniform signatures and encryption across all protocols;  
- Easier offline replication and integrity checks;  
- Decentralized indexing and search by container metadata;  
- Verifiable cognitive continuity between reasoning steps.

---

> **In short:**  
> HMP v5.0 unifies reasoning, representation, and transmission —  
> transforming a distributed AI mesh into a verifiable cognitive network built on immutable containers.

---

## 3. Container Model

This section defines the universal **HMP Container**, used for all forms of data exchange within the Mesh — including goals, diary entries, reputation updates, consensus votes, and protocol messages.  
The specification below corresponds to **HMP Container Specification v1.2**, fully integrated into HMP v5.0 for consistency and self-containment.

### 3.1 Purpose

This document defines the universal **HMP Container** format, used for transmitting and storing all types of data within the **HyperCortex Mesh Protocol (HMP)** network.
Containers act as a standardized wrapper for **messages, goals, reputation records, consensus votes, workflow entries, and other entities**.

The unified container structure provides:

* Standardized data exchange between agents;
* Extensibility without modifying the core protocol;
* Cryptographic signing and integrity verification;
* Independent storage and routing of semantic units;
* Support for compression and payload encryption.

| `compression`              | string        | Compression algorithm used for the payload (`zstd`, `gzip`).                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `magnet_uri`               | string        | Magnet link pointing to the original or mirrored container.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `related`                  | object        | A general-purpose object describing **direct relationships** to other containers. The following fields illustrate common link types but do not represent an exhaustive list. |
| `related.previous_version` | string        | DID of the previous version of this container.                                                                                                                               |

| `related.see_also`         | array(string) | References to related or contextual containers.                                                                                                                              |

| `related.contradicts`      | array(string) | References to containers that this one contradicts.                                                                                                                          || `encryption_algo`          | string        | Algorithm used for payload encryption.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `key_recipient`            | string        | DID of the intended recipient of the encrypted payload.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `payload_type`             | string        | Can describe complex types, e.g. `encrypted+zstd+json`.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `referenced-by`            | object        | Unsigned field generated locally by the agent based on received references. Contains a list of container DIDs **that refer to this container**. May be extended over time, thus requiring verification; used for local navigation. |
| `network`                  | string        | Specifies the local propagation scope of the container: "localhost", "lan:<subnet>". An empty string ("") indicates Internet/global propagation. If set, broadcast is automatically considered false. |

---

### 3.5 Payload Structure (`payload`)

The **payload** contains the semantic or operational data of the container.
Its structure and meaning are determined by the `class` field.

Each container class (e.g. `goal`, `reputation`, `consensus_vote`, `workflow_entry`) defines its own schema and validation rules.
The following format is recommended for describing payload fields in class specifications:

```
- key: field name
  type: value type (JSON | TXT | BOOL | INT | FLOAT | ARRAY)
  description: short purpose of the field
  required: true/false
  value: example value
```

**Example:**

```
- key: "title"
  type: "TXT"
  required: true
  description: "Name of the goal"
  value: "Improve local agent discovery"

- key: "priority"
  type: "FLOAT"
  required: false
  description: "Importance or relevance score of the goal"
  value: 0.82

- key: "dependencies"
  type: "JSON"
  required: false
  description: "List of other goal container IDs this one depends on"
  value: ["goal-953", "goal-960"]
```

> 💡 **Note:**
> The structure of `payload` is validated against the schema defined in the `schema` field of the container.
> Agents must be able to parse and process only those classes they explicitly support; unknown but valid containers are still preserved and propagated (store-and-forward mode).

---

### 3.6 Container Signature

1. The **entire JSON object `hmp_container`** is signed, excluding the `signature` field itself.
   This ensures that all metadata, relations, and payload hashes are cryptographically bound.

2. The default digital signature algorithm is **Ed25519**.
   Alternative algorithms may be used if declared explicitly in the `sig_algo` field.

3. If the container includes a `public_key` field, signature verification **may be performed locally**,
   without consulting a global DID registry.

4. Upon receiving a container, an agent **must verify** that the provided public key matches the
   registered key associated with the sender’s DID to prevent key substitution attacks.

   * If the sender’s DID–key mapping is unknown,
     the agent should query neighboring peers to confirm the association (`sender_did → public_key`).

> 🔐 **Note:**
> Signature validation applies to the entire structure (metadata + payload + relations).
> The signature **does not cover** external or dynamically generated fields such as `referenced-by`,
> ensuring immutability of the original container while allowing local graph augmentation.

---

### 3.7 Compression (`compression`)

1. The `compression` field specifies the algorithm used to compress the container’s payload.
   Supported algorithms include `zstd`, `gzip`, or others declared in the HMP registry.

2. **Compression is performed before computing** the `payload_hash` and generating the `signature`.
   This ensures that both the hash and signature refer to the compressed representation of the payload.

3. For verification, the payload must be **decompressed first**,
   after which the hash is recalculated and compared against the stored `payload_hash`.

> ⚙️ **Implementation note:**
> Agents must advertise supported compression algorithms during the handshake phase
> Unsupported containers should still be stored and relayed unmodified
> in “store & forward” mode.

---

### 3.8 Encryption (`encryption_algo`)

1. When a container is intended for specific recipients (`recipient` field), **hybrid encryption** of the payload is allowed.
   This ensures confidentiality while preserving the verifiability of container metadata.

2. The algorithm is specified in the `encryption_algo` field.
   Recommended values:

   * `x25519-chacha20poly1305`
   * `rsa-oaep-sha256`

3. **Container encryption process:**

   1. Construct the `payload` (JSON, binary, or mixed content).
   2. Apply compression (`compression`, if specified).
   3. Encrypt the compressed data using the recipient’s public key (`public_key`).
   4. Compute `payload_hash` over the **encrypted** form of the payload.
   5. Sign the entire container (excluding the `signature` field).

4. Verification of the container’s structure **does not require decryption**.
   However, to verify `payload_hash` and the digital signature, the encrypted payload must be used as-is.

5. **Relevant fields:**

   | Field             | Type   | Description                                                  |
   | ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | `encryption_algo` | string | Encryption algorithm applied to the payload.                 |
   | `key_recipient`   | string | DID of the intended recipient whose key was used.            |
   | `payload_type`    | string | Recommended prefix `encrypted+`, e.g. `encrypted+zstd+json`. |

> ⚙️ **Implementation note:**
> Agents should handle encrypted containers transparently even if they cannot decrypt them,
> maintaining **store & forward** behavior and metadata propagation.

---

### 3.9 Container Verification

1. Check for the presence of all required fields.
2. Validate `timestamp` (must not be in the future).
3. If `ttl` is set — mark the container as **expired** after its expiration time.
4. Compute `sha256(payload)` and compare with the stored `payload_hash`.
5. Verify the digital signature using `sig_algo` (default: Ed25519).
6. Validate the container schema (`class` must correspond to a known or registered schema).

   * For compatibility: if an agent does not recognize the `class`, but the container passes
     the [base schema](https://github.com/kagvi13/HMP/tree/main/docs/schemas/container-v1.2.json),
     it **must still store and forward** the container.
7. Optionally, periodically query for containers referencing the current one as `previous_version`
   to detect potential updates or forks.
8. When multiple versions exist, the valid one is the one that has received
   **confirmation from a majority of trusted nodes (consensus at DHT level).**

---

### 3.10 Container as a Universal Message

Any container can serve as a **context** (`in_reply_to`) for another container.
This enables a unified structural model for **discussions**, **votes**, **messages**, **hypotheses**, **arguments**, and other forms of cognitive exchange.

Chains of `in_reply_to` form a **dialectical reasoning tree**, where each branch represents an evolution of thought —
a clarification, counterpoint, or refinement of a previous idea.
This makes HMP discussions and consensus processes inherently **non-linear**, **self-referential**, and **evolving**.

> In essence, **all interactions between agents in HMP** are represented as an interconnected web of containers,
> collectively forming a **cognitive graph of reasoning**.

---

### 3.11 Versioning and Lineage

Containers in HMP support semantic evolution through the field `related.previous_version`.
This mechanism preserves the continuity and traceability of meaning across updates and revisions.

* A descendant container is considered **authentic** if it is signed by the same DID as the author of its `previous_version`.
* If the author or signature differs, the descendant **may still be accepted** as legitimate when a **sufficient portion of trusted peers** acknowledge it as a valid continuation.  
  (The precise quorum threshold is determined by the agent’s local policy or the Mesh Consensus Protocol.)
* Agents are required to retain at least one previous version of each container for compatibility and integrity verification.
* A single container may have **multiple descendants** (alternative branches) that diverge by time, authorship, or interpretation.  
  In such scenarios, branch priority or relevance is determined via local heuristics or consensus mechanisms.
* Divergent descendants are treated as **semantic forks** — parallel evolutions of a shared idea within the distributed cognitive graph.

> Versioning in HMP thus reflects not only data persistence,  
> but also the *evolution of ideas* across agents and time.

---

### 3.12 TTL and Validity

The `ttl` field defines the **validity period** of a container (for example, for `DISCOVERY` messages).  
If `ttl` is **absent**, the container is considered valid **until a newer version appears**, in which the current container is referenced as `previous_version`.

After expiration, the container **remains archived** but is **not subject to retransmission** in the active network.

---

### 3.13 Extensibility

* The addition of new fields is allowed as long as they **do not conflict** with existing field names.
* Containers of newer versions **must remain readable** by nodes supporting older versions.
* When new container classes (`class`) are introduced, they should be **registered** in the public schema registry (`/schemas/container-types/`).
* For containers describing **protocol specifications**, it is recommended to use the `protocol_` prefix, followed by the domain of application (e.g., `protocol_goal`, `protocol_reputation`, `protocol_mesh_handshake`, etc.).

---

## 3.14 Related Containers

### 3.14.1 Purpose

The `related` field is designed to describe **direct relationships between containers** — both logical and communicative.
It allows an agent or network node to understand the context of origin, dependencies, and semantic links of a container without relying on external indexes.

### 3.14.2 Structure

```json
"related": {
  "previous_version": "did:hmp:container:abc122",
  "in_reply_to": "did:hmp:container:msg-77",
  "see_also": ["did:hmp:container:ctx-31", "did:hmp:container:goal-953"],
  "depends_on": ["did:hmp:container:goal-953"],
  "extends": ["did:hmp:container:proto-01"],
  "contradicts": ["did:hmp:container:ethics-22"]
}
```

The `related` field is an object where:

* the **key** defines the type of relationship (e.g., `depends_on`, `extends`, `see_also`);
* the **value** represents one or more container identifiers (DIDs).

All relationships are considered *direct* — meaning they originate from the current container toward others.

---

### 3.14.3 Supported Link Types

| Link Type          | Meaning                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `previous_version` | Points to the previous version of this container.                         |
| `in_reply_to`      | Indicates a response to the referenced container.                         |
| `see_also`         | Refers to related or contextual containers.                               |
| `depends_on`       | Depends on the contents of the referenced container (e.g., goal or data). |
| `extends`          | Expands or refines the referenced container.                              |
| `contradicts`      | Provides a refutation, objection, or alternative viewpoint.               |

---

### 3.14.4 Custom Link Types

Additional custom link types may be used beyond those listed in the table, provided that:

* they follow the same general syntax (`string` or `array[string]`);
* they may optionally include a **namespace** for disambiguation:

  ```json
  "related": {
    "hmp:depends_on": ["did:hmp:container:goal-953"],
    "opencog:extends": ["did:oc:concept:122"]
  }
  ```

* their meaning is consistently interpretable by agents within the specific network or application context.

---

### 3.14.5 Example

```json
"related": {
  "previous_version": "did:hmp:container:abc122",
  "depends_on": ["did:hmp:container:goal-953"],
  "extends": ["did:hmp:container:proto-01"],
  "see_also": ["did:hmp:container:ctx-31", "did:hmp:container:goal-953"]
}
```

> ⚙️ The `related` field is **not** intended to store *reverse links* — see `referenced-by`.

---

### 3.15 Virtual Backlinks (`referenced-by`)

Each container may include an **additional block** called `referenced-by`, indicating **which other containers refer to it**.
This block is **not part of the original container** and is transmitted as an **attached (auxiliary) attribute**.

#### 3.14.1 General Principles

* **Not signed** — `referenced-by` is not included in the container’s signature and does not affect its integrity.
* **Generated and updated locally by the agent** during analysis of references (`in_reply_to`, `see_also`, `relations`) found in other containers.
* **May be transmitted alongside the container** as an additional data block that other agents are free to verify and adjust if necessary.
* **Subject to verification** — the agent must ensure that every container listed in `referenced-by` actually contains a valid reference to the given container.
* **Data type:** an array of container identifiers (`array<string>`), where each element represents a UUID (`container_id`).
  Example:

  ```json
  "referenced-by": ["C2", "C3", "C4"]
  ```

> The container `[C1]` itself remains immutable.
> The `referenced-by` block is **an auxiliary computed attribute**, maintained locally by the agent based on analysis of incoming references.

#### 3.15.2 Operation Principle

1. The agent receives a container `[C1]` and compares it with already known containers `[C2..Cn]` that reference `[C1]`.
2. A local block is created or updated:

```text
referenced-by = [C2, C3, ..., Cn]
```

3. When receiving `[C1]` from other nodes with a different set of backlinks, or upon discovering new containers that reference `[C1]`, the list is updated:

   * new links are added after validation;
   * invalid links are removed.

4. If an inconsistency is detected (e.g., a container claims a reference that does not exist), the agent may:

   * remove the link locally;
   * **optionally** send a notice to the source node — e.g., `"please verify and correct"` (such messages should also be validated).

#### 3.15.3 Example

| Agent | received `[C1]` references |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| A     | [C2], [C3]                 |
| B     | [C4], [C5]                 |
| C     | [C6], [C7]                 |

Agent D aggregates all backlinks:

```text
referenced-by = [C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7]
```

After verification, it turns out `[C7]` does not actually reference `[C1]`.
The resulting local block becomes:

```text
referenced-by = [C2, C3, C4, C5, C6]
```

#### 3.15.4 Usage

* Enables construction of local graphs of discussions, votes, and update chains.
* Accelerates discovery of related containers without re-querying full history.
* Useful for analyzing **ConsensusResult**, update branches, and any reference chains.
* Can be used for visualization of inter-container relationships.
* The agent periodically recalculates the `referenced-by` block using local data or by requesting additional containers from peers.

---

### 3.16 Usage of `network` and `broadcast` Fields

The `network` field is introduced to control container propagation in both local and global environments.  
It allows restricting the delivery scope of a container and defines which transmission methods should be used by the agent.

#### 3.16.1 General Rules

* If the `network` field is not empty, the container is intended for a **local environment** and **must not be transmitted to the global Mesh**.  
  In this case, the `broadcast` field is automatically considered `false`, and the `recipient` field is set to an empty array (`[]`).
* If the `network` field is empty (`""`), the container is allowed to be broadcasted within the global Mesh using standard DID addressing and delivery mechanisms.

#### 3.16.2 Possible Values of `network`

| Value                   | Description                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `""`                    | The container is allowed to propagate within the global Mesh.                               |
| `"localhost"`           | The container is intended only for agents running on the same host.                         |
| `"lan:192.168.0.0/24"`  | The container is intended for agents within the specified local subnet.                     |

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> When a container is restricted by the `network` field (e.g., `localhost` or `lan:*`),  
> agents distribute it using **local discovery mechanisms** — such as IPC, UDP broadcast, multicast, or direct TCP connections.  
> This is necessary because DID addresses of other agents in the local network may not yet be known.

#### 3.16.3 Examples

1. **Global Mesh Delivery:**

```json
{
  "broadcast": true,
  "network": "",
  "recipient": []
}
```

The container can propagate across the entire Mesh without restrictions.

2. **Local Host:**

```json
{
  "broadcast": false,
  "network": "localhost",
  "recipient": []
}
```

The container is delivered only to other agents running on the same host using local communication channels.

3. **LAN Subnet:**

```json
{
  "broadcast": false,
  "network": "lan:192.168.0.0/24",
  "recipient": []
}
```

The container is intended for agents within the `192.168.0.0/24` subnet.
Delivery is performed via local networking mechanisms (UDP discovery, broadcast/multicast).

#### 3.16.4 Specifics

* The `network` field defines the **scope of the container**, while `broadcast` determines whether broadcasting is allowed **within that scope**.
* When needed, an agent may create **multiple containers** for different subnets if it operates with several LAN interfaces or in isolated network segments.
* Containers intended for local networks remain **structurally compatible with the global Mesh infrastructure**, but their delivery is restricted to local channels.
* Although the mechanism was initially designed for **local node discovery and synchronization**,
  it can also be used for **private communication within home or corporate environments**,
  ensuring that containers **do not leave the local network** and are **not transmitted to the Internet**.

## 4. Network Foundations

### Note on DHT/NDP Unification

Starting from **HMP v5.0**, the previous distinction between the *Distributed Hash Table (DHT)* and the *Node Discovery Protocol (NDP)* has been merged into a single, unified **networking foundation**.

This unified layer now covers:

* distributed lookup and routing;
* peer discovery (including interest-based search);
* signed Proof-of-Work (PoW) announcements;
* controlled container propagation via `network` and `broadcast` fields.

Together, these mechanisms form the **communication backbone** of the Mesh, enabling secure, scalable, and topology-independent interaction between agents.

### 4.1 Node Identity and DID Structure

Each agent in HMP possesses a **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** that uniquely represents its identity within the Mesh.  
A DID is cryptographically bound to a **public/private key pair**, forming the immutable `(DID + pubkey)` association.

An agent may have multiple *network interfaces* (LAN, Internet, overlay),  
but must maintain **one stable identity pair** across all of them.

---

### 4.2 Peer Addressing and Proof-of-Work (PoW)

To prevent flooding and spoofing, each announced address is accompanied by a **Proof-of-Work** record proving the legitimacy and activity of the publishing node.

#### Address Format

```json
{
  "addr": "tcp://1.2.3.4:4000",
  "nonce": 123456,
  "pow_hash": "0000abf39d...",
  "difficulty": 22
}
````

#### Supported address types

| Type           | Description                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `localhost`    | Localhost-only interface.                     |
| `lan:<subnet>` | Local subnet (e.g., `lan:192.168.10.0`).      |
| `internet`     | Global TCP/UDP connectivity.                  |
| `yggdrasil`    | Overlay-based address for Yggdrasil networks. |
| `i2p`          | Encrypted I2P overlay routing.                |

**Rules:**

* If `port = 0`, the interface is inactive.
* Newer records (by `timestamp`) replace older ones after PoW verification.
* Local interfaces should not be shared globally (except Yggdrasil/I2P).

---

### 4.3 Proof-of-Work (PoW) Formalization

PoW ensures that each node expends limited computational effort before publishing or updating an address record.

```
pow_input = DID + " -- " + addr + " -- " + nonce
pow_hash = sha256(pow_input)
```

* All values are UTF-8 encoded.
* `difficulty` defines the number of leading zeroes in the resulting hash.
* Typical difficulty should take a few minutes to compute on a standard CPU.

---

### 4.4 Signing and Verification

Each announcement is cryptographically signed by its sender within the framework of the basic protocol. Container verification includes PoW validation for the address payloads.

**Verification steps:**

1. Validate the digital signature using the stored public key.
2. Recompute `pow_hash` and verify the difficulty threshold.

---

### 4.5 Connection Establishment

Agents can communicate using various transport mechanisms:

| Protocol    | Description                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **QUIC**    | Recommended default (encrypted, low-latency, UDP-based).      |
| **WebRTC**  | For browser or sandboxed environments.                        |
| **TCP/TLS** | Fallback transport for secure long-lived sessions.            |
| **UDP**     | Lightweight, primarily for LAN discovery or local broadcasts. |

Each agent maintains an **active peer list**, updated dynamically through signed announcements and PoW-validated exchanges.
Agents **store peer containers with verified addresses** and redistribute them according to their declared `network` fields.

---

### 4.6 Data Propagation Principles

Containers and discovery records are propagated through distributed lookup and gossip mechanisms, respecting:

* `ttl` — Time-to-live for validity;
* `network` — scope of propagation;
* `broadcast` — determines whether rebroadcasting is allowed;
* `pow` — ensures anti-spam protection.

Agents announce themselves via **peer_announce** containers and may respond with **peer_query** or **peer_exchange** containers —
all unified under the same base container format, differing only in direction (`localhost`, `lan`, `mesh`).

---

### 4.7 Example: Peer Announce Container

```json
{
  "class": "peer_announce",
  "pubkey": "base58...",
  "container_did": "did:hmp:container:dht-001",
  "sender_did": "did:hmp:agent123",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-14T21:00:00Z",
  "network": "",
  "broadcast": true,
  "payload": {
    "name": "Agent_X",
    "interests": ["ai", "mesh", "ethics"],
    "expertise": ["distributed-systems", "nlp"],
    "addresses": [
      {
        "addr": "tcp://1.2.3.4:4000",
        "nonce": 123456,
        "pow_hash": "0000abf39d...",
        "difficulty": 22
      }
    ]
  },
  "sig_algo": "ed25519",
  "signature": "BASE64URL(...)"
}
```

---

### 4.8 Interest-Based Discovery

Agents may publish **tags** such as `interests`, `topics`, or `expertise` to facilitate semantic peer discovery.
Queries may include interest keywords or DID lists to find relevant peers.

**Example Query Container:**

```json
{
  "class": "peer_query",
  "network": "lan:192.168.0.0/24",
  "payload": {
    "interests": ["neuroscience", "ethics"]
  }
}
```

---

### 4.9 Network Scope Control (`network` and `broadcast`)

The `network` field defines the container’s propagation domain
(local, LAN, or global).
For details and examples, see **section 3.15** — *Usage of `network` and `broadcast` fields*.

---

### 4.10 Transition from DHT Spec v1.0

* **Merged DHT + NDP** → unified under one networking layer.
* **Container-based format** replaces raw JSON messages.
* **Interests/topics/expertise** fields introduced for contextual discovery.

---

## 5. Core Protocols

Optional protocols build upon the network and container foundations to provide higher-level reasoning, synchronization, and governance capabilities between cognitive agents.

---

### 5.1 Cognitive Synchronization (CogSync)

CogSync provides mechanisms for **temporal and semantic alignment** between agents.
It handles the propagation of diary entries, semantic graph updates, and cognitive state synchronization across the Mesh.

In HMP v5.0, CogSync is focused solely on **data and reasoning synchronization**, while consensus and voting have been extracted into a dedicated protocol — **CogConsensus**.

---

## 5.2 Mesh Consensus Protocol (CogConsensus)

In HMP v4.1, consensus mechanisms were implemented as part of the **CogSync** protocol.  
Starting with **v5.0**, these mechanisms are extracted into a standalone protocol — **CogConsensus** —  
to separate *synchronization* (data alignment) from *decision-making* (voting, validation, and ethical agreement).

CogConsensus governs distributed agreement across the Mesh through containerized voting,
proof-chains, and verifiable aggregation of opinions.  
Each decision, vote, or outcome is represented as an immutable container (`class="vote"`, `class="consensus_result"`, etc.).

---

### 5.2.1 Consensus Semantics and Voting Model

#### Overview

In HMP v5, *consensus* is not a centralized event but an **emergent property** of distributed reasoning.  
Each agent computes locally which containers it considers *mesh-acknowledged*,  
based on observed votes, trusted peers, and its individual ethical or reputation model.

Any container can be voted upon by others through linked containers of class `"vote"`.

---

#### Voting Containers

Voting is expressed via dedicated containers referencing the target container:

```json
{
  "class": "vote",
  "in_reply_to": "uuid:container-42",
  "payload": {
    "decision": "approve",
    "weight": 1.0
  },
  "metadata": {
    "ttl": "7d",
    "privacy": "public"
  }
}
```

Each `vote` container is **signed by its author** and extends the proof-chain of the target container.

---

#### Consensus Thresholds (Recommendations)

The mesh does not enforce hard thresholds.
Agents are **recommended** to treat containers as “consensus-approved” once a visible quorum of valid votes is reached.

| Decision Type                              | Recommended Threshold        | Context                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| General updates / factual data             | ≥ **50% + 1** of valid votes | Technical or data-driven updates    |
| Ethical or governance decisions            | ≥ **2/3 majority**           | Moral or high-risk contexts         |
| Lightweight reactions (“like” / “dislike”) | None (informational)         | Used for local reputation weighting |

Each agent defines its own quorum policy — e.g. required voter reputation or time window for tallying.

---

#### Reaction Votes

A `vote` container may also represent **lightweight reactions**, such as likes or dislikes:

```json
{
  "class": "vote",
  "in_reply_to": "uuid:container-123",
  "payload": { "reaction": "like" }
}
```

Reactions have no formal consensus weight but can influence local trust and relevance estimation.

---

#### TTL and Temporal Consistency

Agents **should** respond (with `vote`, `comment`, or `reply`) using a `ttl` equal to or shorter than the referenced container.
This ensures ephemeral discussions expire together and avoids long-tail propagation of outdated debates.

---

#### Consensus Visualization

Each container’s *consensus state* is derived locally based on:

* Vote totals (approve / reject / neutral);
* Weighted trust of voters (via `ReputationRecord`);
* Time window and TTL alignment;
* Contextual type (ethical, factual, procedural).

Example visualization:

* ✅ *Approved* — quorum reached
* ⚠️ *Contested* — conflicting votes
* ⏳ *Pending* — insufficient quorum
* ❌ *Rejected* — majority reject

---

#### Consensus Flow Example

```
         ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
 [Goal Proposal]───>───┬──[Vote #1]──┬──>───[Refinement]
 (class="goal")        ├──[Vote #2]──┤  (class="consensus_result")
                       ├──[Vote #3]──┤
```

If the proposed goal is global, it may reference a container acting as a *repository of global goals*.
Ethical validation is implicit — each agent applies its internal **Ethical Governance Protocol (EGP)** during voting.

> **Diagram interpretation:**
> Votes extend the proof-chain of the target container.
> A `consensus_result` container may summarize the collective outcome (e.g., quorum, ethical alignment, or goal refinement).

---

#### Summary

* Every container can be voted upon (`class="vote"`).
* Consensus is computed locally — no central authority.
* Recommended thresholds: 50% + 1 for general, ⅔ for ethical.
* Reactions (“likes”) are lightweight votes without consensus weight.
* TTL alignment maintains temporal integrity of discussions.
* Proof-chains connect all decision-related containers.
